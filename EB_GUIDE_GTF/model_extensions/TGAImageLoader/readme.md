# TGAImageLoader

Extend the currently supported files of an EB GUIDE model, with dedicated decoders for TGA images.
In order to be able to attach TGA format images to an image widget, EB GUIDE Studio needs to be extended with the [TGAImageLoaderPlugin](../../../EB_GUIDE_Studio/TGAImageLoaderPlugin).\
The TGA images can be compressed or decompressed.

For instructions, see [EB GUIDE GTF examples](../../readme.md).
