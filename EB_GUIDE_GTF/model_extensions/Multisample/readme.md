# Multisample

Shows how to create a custom framebuffer with Multisampling effect. The Multisampling widget provides different sample count options.\
This example also shows how to create a custom multisampled framebuffer in two different ways:
* Multisampling by resolving while writing to texture.
* Multisampling by manually resolving the multisampled buffers.

The example contains geometry with simple animations and related controls to illustrate multisampling effects.

With this example you can stop or play animations and you can also change the sample count.
