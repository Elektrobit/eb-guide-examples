# Postprocessing Effect Example: Chromatic Aberration

This example shows how to create a chromatic aberration effect as a part of the postprocessing pipeline. For details on how to use the postprocessing pipeline, see EB GUIDE Studio user guide, section 6.21 "Postprocessing effects".

## Chromatic aberration
Chromatic aberration is caused by lens dispersion, which means that different colors of light travel with different speeds through the lens depending on the wavelengths. The lens cannot focus all the colors at the same point on the image plane. This results in blurred and incorrect colors in the image specifically around the edges of objects in the image. 
The _intensity_ widget feature controls the strength of the chromatic aberrations, with a valid range from 0.0 (no aberration) to 1.0 (maximum aberration).
