# DownscalingWidgetFeature

Adds a custom widget feature, for downscaling JPEG images.
This gives you the opportunity to scale the JPEG image to a given height and width.
Note, that the _imagePath_ property must contain the path to the image e.g. _resources/image.jpeg_.

For instructions see [EB GUIDE GTF examples](../../readme.md)
